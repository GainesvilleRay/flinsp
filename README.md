Here is a start on analyzing restaurant inspection reports filed by the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation.

So far, the files here are:

• districtlook.py -- Puts the csv data into a Pandas dataframe for analysis.

• /1-7/fdinspi.csv -- Summary inspection date from Districts 1-7 in fiscal year 2018-2019 through June 21, 2019.
