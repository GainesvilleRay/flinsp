Here is a start on analyzing restaurant inspection reports filed by the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation.

So far, the files here are:
• 1fdinspi.csv -- Summary inspection date from District 1 in fiscal year 2018-2019 through June 21, 2019.
• districtlook.py -- Puts the csv data into a Pandas dataframe for analysis.
