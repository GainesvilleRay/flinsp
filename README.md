Here is a start on analyzing restaurant inspection reports filed by the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation.

So far, the files here are:

• districtlook.py -- Puts the csv data into a Pandas dataframe for analysis.

• countycount.csv -- how many licensed restaurants in each county in fy2018-19

• countycodes.py -- dictionary of county names and code numbers

• counties.txt -- list of all counties in Florida

• hrfood.py -- a script to produce countycount.csv

• fy2016 -- directory of inspection data in FY2016-17

• fy2017 -- directory of inspection data in FY2017-18

• fy2018 -- directory of inspection data in FY2018-19 and licensed restaurants


The csv files have more than 80 columns. Here is a key to described the columns:
